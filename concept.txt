I'm writing this to have a clear idea of what i'm making.

Purpose:
I'm writing a program that allows you to make 3D models. It will do this by letting you place points in a 3D space and create
faces from them.

Blueprint:
The program will start in a viewing mode. The user will be able to select an axis, on which they will be able to either place
a point down, or produce a selection grid, which they can then traverse to again either place a point down or make a selection grid.

States:
VIEW -> SELECTION
